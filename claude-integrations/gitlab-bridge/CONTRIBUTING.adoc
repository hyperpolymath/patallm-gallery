=== Perimeter 1: Core Maintainers

**By invitation only**

See link:GOVERNANCE.adoc[] for details.

== Development Workflow

=== 1. Find an Issue

* Browse https://github.com/hyperpolymath/claude-gitlab-bridge/issues[open issues]
* Look for `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels
* Comment on the issue to claim it
* Wait for maintainer confirmation

=== 2. Create Feature Branch

[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
----

**Branch naming conventions**:

* `feature/` - New features
* `fix/` - Bug fixes
* `docs/` - Documentation
* `refactor/` - Code refactoring
* `test/` - Tests
* `chore/` - Build, dependencies

=== 3. Make Changes

==== TypeScript Code Style

[source,typescript]
----
// ✅ Good: Clear names, type annotations
function parseGitLabUrl(url: string): Result<RepoContext, ParseError> {
  // Implementation
}

// ❌ Bad: Unclear, no types
function parse(u) {
  // Implementation
}
----

**Guidelines**:

* Descriptive variable and function names
* Type annotations on public functions
* Return types for error handling
* Comments for complex logic
* Small, focused functions
* Avoid any type

==== Testing

[source,bash]
----
# Run tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Coverage
npm run test:coverage
----

**Coverage targets**:

* Overall: 80%+
* New files: 90%+
* Critical paths: 100%

**Write tests for**:

* All new functionality
* Bug fixes (regression tests)
* Edge cases
* Error conditions

=== 4. Commit Changes

We follow https://www.conventionalcommits.org/[Conventional Commits]:

[source,bash]
----
git commit -m "feat(parser): add Azure DevOps support"
git commit -m "fix(api): handle rate limiting correctly"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
----

**Commit types**:

* `feat` - New feature
* `fix` - Bug fix
* `docs` - Documentation
* `style` - Formatting
* `refactor` - Code refactoring
* `test` - Tests
* `chore` - Build, dependencies
* `perf` - Performance improvement
* `ci` - CI/CD changes

**Commit guidelines**:

* One logical change per commit
* Clear, descriptive messages
* Reference issues: `fixes #123`
* Keep commits atomic

=== 5. Push and Create PR

[source,bash]
----
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
----

Then open a Pull Request with:

* **Clear title**: Following conventional commit format
