== Overview

This document defines the governance structure for the Claude GitLab Bridge project. We use the Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF) to manage community participation and decision-making.

== Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

The TPCF organizes contributors into three perimeters based on trust, expertise, and commitment level.

=== Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox

**Description**: The outer perimeter where new contributors start. Open to anyone who follows our Code of Conduct.

**Privileges**:

* Participate in discussions
* Comment on issues and PRs
* Vote in community polls
* Access public documentation

**Requirements**:

* Follow link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[Code of Conduct]
* Respectful communication
* Good faith participation

**How to Join**: Simply start contributing! All community members begin here.

* Access to private contributor channels

**Responsibilities**:

=== Perimeter 1: Core Maintainers

**Status**: By invitation only

**Description**: Project leaders with full commit access and decision-making authority.

**Current Members**:

* See link:MAINTAINERS.md[]

**Requirements to Enter**:

* Minimum 6 months as Perimeter 2 contributor
* Significant technical contributions
* Demonstrated leadership
* Strategic vision alignment
* Unanimous approval from existing Perimeter 1 members

**Additional Privileges**:

* Merge pull requests
* Create releases

* Invite new maintainers
* Final decision authority
* Access to security reports
* Moderate community spaces

**Responsibilities**:

* Strategic direction
* Release management
* Security response
* Conflict resolution
* Community health
* Legal compliance
* Budget management (if applicable)

== Decision-Making Process

=== Consensus

We strive for consensus on all major decisions. Consensus means:

* All voices are heard
* Objections are addressed
* Agreement is reached through discussion

=== Voting

When consensus cannot be reached, decisions are made by vote:

**Perimeter 3 Decisions** (Feature requests, minor changes)::
Simple majority of participants in the discussion

**Perimeter 2 Decisions** (Technical architecture, dependencies)::
2/3 majority of Perimeter 2 + Perimeter 1 members

**Perimeter 1 Decisions** (Governance changes, security policies)::
Unanimous approval from Perimeter 1 maintainers

=== RFC Process

For significant changes, we use an RFC (Request for Comments) process:

1. **Draft**: Author creates RFC document
2. **Discussion**: 2-week community discussion period
3. **Revision**: RFC updated based on feedback
4. **Decision**: Vote held if consensus not reached
5. **Implementation**: Approved RFCs move to implementation

== Roles and Responsibilities

=== Project Roles

**Project Lead**::
Strategic vision, final decision authority, community representation

**Technical Lead**::
Architecture decisions, code quality, technical direction

**Release Manager**::
Version releases, changelog management, release automation

**Community Manager**::
Community health, communication, event organization

**Security Lead**::
Security policies, vulnerability response, security audits

=== Role Assignment

Roles are assigned by Perimeter 1 maintainers based on:

* Demonstrated expertise
* Time commitment
* Community trust
* Project needs

== Code Review Process

All code changes require review before merging:

**Perimeter 3 PRs**::
* Require 1 review from Perimeter 2 or Perimeter 1
* Must pass all automated checks
* May require revisions

**Perimeter 2 PRs**::
* Require 1 review from Perimeter 2 or Perimeter 1
* Fast-track for minor changes
* May self-merge after approval

**Perimeter 1 PRs**::
* Require 1 review from another Perimeter 1 member
* May self-merge for urgent fixes
* Should still get review when possible

== Conflict Resolution

=== Process

1. **Direct Communication**: Parties attempt to resolve directly
2. **Mediation**: Community Manager or neutral third party mediates
3. **Escalation**: Perimeter 1 maintainers make final decision
4. **Appeal**: Decisions can be appealed once to full Perimeter 1

=== Code of Conduct Violations

See link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[] for enforcement procedures.

== Changes to Governance

Governance changes require:

1. RFC process with 4-week discussion period
2. Unanimous approval from Perimeter 1
3. Public announcement with rationale
4. 30-day comment period before taking effect

== Perimeter Movement

=== Promotion

* Perimeter 3 → 2: Nominated by any Perimeter 1, 2/3 vote of Perimeter 2+1
* Perimeter 2 → 1: Nominated by any Perimeter 1, unanimous vote of Perimeter 1

=== Demotion

Members may be moved to outer perimeters for:

* Inactivity (6+ months with notice)
* Code of Conduct violations
* Loss of trust
* Personal request

Process:

1. Private discussion with member
2. Perimeter 1 vote (majority required)
3. Public announcement with respect and gratitude

=== Voluntary Step Down

Members may voluntarily move to outer perimeters at any time. We thank them for their service.

== Transparency

* All governance decisions
* Meeting notes (non-sensitive)
* Voting results
* Perimeter membership
* Role assignments
