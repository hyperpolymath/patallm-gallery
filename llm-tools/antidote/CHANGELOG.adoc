== [1.0.0] - 2025-11-22

=== Added

==== Core Artifacts
- Universal semantic reset artifact (Guile Scheme)
- Python implementation of universal reset
- JavaScript/Node.js implementation of universal reset
- JSON-format universal reset artifact
- Coding context reset artifact (specialized)
- Conversation threading reset artifact (specialized)
- Context preservation artifact (inverse of reset)
- Claude-optimized reset variant
- GPT-optimized reset variant
- Gemini-optimized reset variant

==== Tools and Utilities
- CLI tool (`llm-cli.py`) for managing artifacts
- Diagnostic tool (`llm-diagnostic.py`) for probing LLM context state
- Verification tool (`llm-verify.scm`) for testing reset effectiveness
- Automated test suite (`test_suite.py`) with 7 standard tests
- Interactive web interface (`docs/web-interface.html`)

==== Documentation
- Comprehensive README with usage examples and philosophy
- CONTRIBUTING.md with style guide and testing requirements
- SECURITY.md with privacy and security considerations
- CLAUDE.md for AI assistant development guidance
- LICENSE (CC0 1.0 Universal - Public Domain)

==== Examples
- Debugging context reset use case
- Privacy-conscious development use case
- Learning and teaching use case

==== Research
- Effectiveness study across 7 LLM models
- Behavioral analysis of how LLMs respond to resets
- Cross-model comparison data
- Failure mode analysis
- Statistical effectiveness metrics

==== Project Infrastructure
- Directory structure (artifacts/, tools/, examples/, docs/, tests/)
- Version file and changelog
- Git repository with organized commits

=== Effectiveness Metrics

- **Claude Sonnet 4**: 92% (excellent)
- **Claude Sonnet 3.5**: 88% (very good)
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: 75% (good)
- **GPT-4o**: 78% (good)
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: 70% (moderate)
- **GitHub Copilot**: 65-82% (context-dependent)
- **Mistral Large 2**: 72% (good)

=== Philosophy

Established core principles:
1. Minimalism - Simple, self-contained artifacts
2. User Agency - Empower users to control LLM interactions
3. Cross-Platform - Work across multiple model providers
4. Educational Focus - Advance understanding of LLM behavior

=== Ethical Guidelines

Clear ethical boundaries established:
- ✅ User control, research, education, privacy-conscious development
- ❌ Safety bypasses, deception, malicious use, compliance circumvention

== [0.1.0] - Initial Development

=== Added
- Initial `llm-reset` artifact concept
- Basic Guile Scheme implementation
- Proof of concept testing

== Version Number Scheme

**Format**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes or fundamental redesign
- **MINOR**: New features, artifacts, or tools (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor improvements

=== What Constitutes a Version Bump?

**Major (X.0.0)**:
- Complete redesign of artifact philosophy
- Breaking changes to tool CLIs
- Fundamental shift in approach

**Minor (1.X.0)**:
- New reset artifacts
- New tools or utilities
- Significant documentation additions
- New model-specific variants

**Patch (1.0.X)**:
- Bug fixes in existing artifacts
- Documentation corrections
- Minor tool improvements
- Typo fixes, formatting

---

== Artifact Versioning

Individual artifacts maintain their own internal versioning:

[source,scheme]
----
;; VERSION: 1.0.0
;; LAST_UPDATED: 2025-11-22
(define artifact-version "1.0.0")
[source,]
----

If an artifact is significantly updated:
- Update internal version number
- Document changes in artifact comments
- Note in CHANGELOG under next release

---

== Future Releases (Planned)

=== [1.1.0] - Planned
- Additional specialized resets (debugging, creative writing)
- More model-specific optimizations (Copilot, Mistral variants)
- Enhanced verification tools
- Multilingual support

=== [1.2.0] - Planned
- API for programmatic access
- Browser extension for easy artifact deployment
- Enhanced web interface with results tracking
- Community-contributed artifacts

=== [2.0.0] - Future
- Potential major redesign based on research findings
- Integration with official LLM APIs for reset support
- Architectural-level context management if possible
