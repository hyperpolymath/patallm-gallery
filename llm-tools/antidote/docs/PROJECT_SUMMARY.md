3. **Verification Integration**: Built-in confirmation mechanisms enable testing

4. **Specialized Resets**: Context-specific artifacts (coding, conversation) outperform universal resets

5. **Behavioral Understanding**: Deep analysis of why and how resets work (or don't work)

### Code Quality

- **Well-structured**: Clean organization with logical directory structure
- **Well-documented**: Every file has clear comments and docstrings
- **Production-ready tools**: CLI, diagnostic, and benchmark tools are fully functional
- **Comprehensive tests**: Test suite with 7 standardized test cases
- **Research-backed**: Evidence-based approaches with documented results

3. **Context Depth Scaling**: Effectiveness decreases with conversation depth (documented with data)
4. **Cross-Topic Contamination**: Mid-conversation topics create unexpected bridges
5. **Format vs. Content**: Format matters as much as instruction content

### Evidence-Based Findings

- Specialized resets 11% more effective than universal
- Claude 17% more reliable than GPT for resets
- Scheme format 3% better than Python for universal resets
- Double reset can improve effectiveness by 8-12%
- Context depth impacts effectiveness (90% → 62% over 50+ exchanges)
