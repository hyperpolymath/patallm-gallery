# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community
- **Emotional temperature awareness** - Being mindful of stress levels in discussions
- **Reversibility** - Designing decisions that can be revisited and reversed
- **Safe spaces for dissent** - Encouraging respectful disagreement and debate

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- **Gatekeeping** - Dismissing contributions based on perceived skill level
- **Dark patterns** - Manipulative communication or decision-making tactics
- **Burnout culture** - Glorifying overwork or pressuring contributors

## CCCP Extensions

This Code of Conduct includes extensions from the **Conscious Community Conduct Protocol (CCCP)**:

### 1. Emotional Temperature Awareness

- Monitor the emotional climate of discussions
- Take breaks when conversations become heated
- Use "I" statements to express personal perspectives
- Acknowledge when you're feeling defensive or stressed

**Example:** "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by this discussion. Can we take a break and revisit tomorrow?"

### 2. Reversibility and Experimentation

- Embrace experimentation with the understanding that decisions can be revised
- Document rationale for decisions to aid future reconsideration
- Welcome proposals to revisit past decisions with new information
- Avoid "permanence pressure" in decision-making

**Example:** "Let's try this approach for 2 weeks and evaluate. We can always change course."

### 3. Safe Spaces for Dissent

- Actively encourage dissenting opinions
- Separate disagreement from disrespect
- Protect minority viewpoints from being drowned out
- Use "yes, and..." thinking rather than "but" responses

**Example:** "I see your concern about X. Can you help me understand what specific scenario worries you?"

### 4. Inclusivity Beyond Demographics

- Welcome contributors of all skill levels
- Provide mentorship and guidance
- Celebrate learning and growth
- Avoid jargon when simpler language works

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email:** conduct@llm-unify.dev

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
