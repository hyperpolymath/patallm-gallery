= DYADT Roadmap

== Current Status: v0.1.0

12-layer verification pipeline fully implemented with triple API and SLM ensemble.

== Completed (v0.1.0)

=== Foundation
* [x] Core verification types (Claim, Evidence, Verdict)
* [x] 12-layer verification pipeline (all layers implemented)
* [x] CLI tool (check, verify, hash, report commands)
* [x] JSON claim serialization
* [x] Claim extractor from LLM output text

=== Verification Layers
* [x] Layers 1-7: File existence, content hash, syntactic validity, semantic integrity, test execution, diff coherence, dependency resolution
* [x] Layer 8: Cross-reference analysis (import/export graph, contradiction detection, temporal validation)
* [x] Layer 9: Completeness audit (claimed-but-missing files, stub detection, orphaned tests)
* [x] Layer 10: Regression guard (baseline comparison, regression detection)
* [x] Layer 11: SLM consensus (ensemble voting with GoT + MoE)
* [x] Layer 12: Pattern learning (violation tracking, frequency analysis, risk scoring)

=== SLM Ensemble
* [x] Policy Oracle (Tier 1) — 12 cognitive-gating violation categories
* [x] Graph-of-Thought backend — 3 adversarial reasoning paths
* [x] Mixture-of-Experts backend — violation-routed expert selection
* [x] Ensemble aggregation with asymmetric weighting (1.5x for rejections)

=== API
* [x] REST API on port 4200
* [x] GraphQL API via Absinthe (port 4200, path /api/graphql)
* [x] gRPC API on port 4201
* [x] Single context module (DyadtBrain.Verifications)

=== Infrastructure
* [x] Erlang Port Protocol (Rust <-> Elixir)
* [x] Container deployment (Containerfile, selur-compose.toml)
* [x] Idris2 ABI definitions with formal proofs
* [x] Zig FFI C-compatible implementation
* [x] 204 tests (130 Rust + 74 Elixir), 0 failures

== Planned (v0.2.0)

=== Real SLM Inference
* [ ] llama.cpp integration via llama-cpp-2 crate
* [ ] TinyLlama-1.1B for lightweight evaluation
* [ ] Phi-2 for higher-quality evaluation
* [ ] Model download and caching

=== Enhanced Evidence
* [ ] HTTP reachability checker
* [ ] Regex content matching
* [ ] JSON path verification
* [ ] Git blame integration

=== Deployment
* [ ] Publish to crates.io
* [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD
* [ ] VeriSimDB integration (automated pipeline)

== Planned (v1.0.0)

=== Production
* [ ] Property-based testing (proptest)
* [ ] Async verification support
* [ ] Rate limiting and authentication
* [ ] Telemetry and observability

=== Ecosystem
* [ ] gitbot-fleet integration (finishbot verification)
* [ ] Hypatia neurosymbolic scanning
* [ ] echidna proofing enrollment
* [ ] panic-attack security scanning

== Future Directions

* Real-time verification during LLM sessions
* IDE plugins (VS Code, Neovim)
* Cross-repo verification (monorepo support)
* Verification attestation certificates
